* Use npm from `package.json` to try to use installed dependencies rather than installing new dependencies, if possible.
* Make sure dependency version compatibility
* It is a good idea to remove legacy code if got conflicts, no need of keeping legacy compatibility.
* Encouraged to merge code if code logic is similar to existing code, rather than creating new files and functions.
* Consider using 3rd party dependencies for the requirements of the new feature or bug fix rather than reinvent the wheel delivering lots of functionality.
* If the change is large, break it down into smaller tasks and create a todo list.
* Set up a new file if new feature is large.
* encouraged to do less code change than chunky code change, if the change is large, break it down into smaller tasks and create a todo list.
* For JIRA and Confluence and git dummy servers, simulate what real world api would be like, and implement the feature based on the simulated api, so that the code can be easily adapted to real world api in the future.
